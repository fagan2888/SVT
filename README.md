# SVT
Singular Value Thresholding "SVT" (legacy code)

This is taken from the SVT website [svt.stanford.edu](http://svt.stanford.edu); please refer to that website for information on what SVT is used for. This repository contains MATLAB code, along with C/mex code, so it must be installed with a compiler.

Specifically, these files were taken from the most recent package there, [svt.stanford.edu/code/SVT_2011-04-25.zip](http://svt.stanford.edu/code/SVT_2011-04-25.zip), and were updated starting in June 2019 to be compatible with recent OS and Matlab versions.

This package is not *actively* maintained, and SVT is not always the best state-of-the-art algorithm, but we'll do our best to give partial support.

Original code written for SVT by Emmanuel Cand√®s and Stephen Becker, in addition to code for PROPACK. This variant of PROPACK has been re-used in many other matrix completion codes.

# Compiling instructions
Download the entire repository, then go to the `SVD_utilities` subdirectory and run `install_mex.m` from within MATLAB.  Test this with `test_MEX.m` and `test_PROPACK.m`.  Then go back to the parent directory and run `Test_SVT.m`

Note: we have included precompiled binaries for several architectures; you may want to try these before running `insteall_mex.m` in case they work out-of-the-box for you
